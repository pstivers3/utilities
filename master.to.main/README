## assumptions

1. The first remote listed from "git remote -v" points to the cloned repo.
2. There is optionally a second remote listed from "git remote -v".
3. There is not greater than 2 remotes.

## perform the following in command line before running this script

1. bring the  master branch up to date and ensure the working tree is clean

    if there's an upstream remote

        $ git checkout master
        $ git pull upstream master
        $ git push origin master

    $ git status # ensure the working tree is clean

## notes

1. The name of the remotes isn't important. The script captures the name
and URL of up to 2 remotes. Again, the script assumes that the first remote
points to the cloned repo.

2. the script echos out each command then runs the command, so that if
you see errors in the outut,  you will know which command they came from.

3. Run the script at the root of the repo.

repo$ master-to-main.sh
